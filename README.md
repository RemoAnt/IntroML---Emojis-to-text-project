## Introduction

This project focuses on making it easier to understand and express emotions using emojis in digital conversations. This project interprets meaning in sets of three emojis using machine learning. It generates contextually relevant sentences, bridging the gap between emojis and natural language.

## Project Overview

We aim to design a Discord bot that can analyze and interpret Combination of emojis and respond with well-constructed sentences that convey the intended meaning behind the emojis. 

## Methodology 1

We will use image recognition to identify the emojis into text/label. Afterwards we send this text into the Transformer for sentence generation and sentimental analysis.
Flow: Emoji->Image Recognition->Emoji Label(Text)->Language Transformer->Sentence

## Methodology 2

We will convert the emoji into its unicode representation, which will be translated into text (label). Afterwards we will send this text into the Transformer for sentence generation and sentimental analysis.
Flow: Emoji->Unicode Representation->Emoji Label (Text)->Language Transformer->Sentence
